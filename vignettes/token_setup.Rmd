Most of the work in getting access to the xMart4 API has to be done outside of R.
This primarily consists of setting up a client application in WHO AzureAD and
supplying that client's ID and secret to the xMart4 API. Once your client has
access to the xMart4 API, mart permissions can be managed by the admin of
each mart individually. Full details on this process can be found on the [xMart4
Slack Wiki](https://xmartcollaboration.slack.com/files/TJF6QTLE4/F019WGZSSD7?origin_team=TJF6QTLE4).

This package works to streamline the process on the R side by making access to
xMart4 as simple as possible. If the client configuration is properly done, then
this package allows you full access to xMart4 by only editing your `.Renviron`
file once. Add your `remoteClientID` and `remoteClientSecret` from WHO AzureAD to
that by running `usethis::edit_r_environ()` and adding these two lines (replacing
hashes with actual client ID and secret values):

```{r eval = FALSE}
XMART_REMOTE_CLIENT_ID = "############"
XMART_REMOTE_CLIENT_SECRET = "############"
```
Save the file and restart your R session. You will now be able to access all 
xMart4 marts your client app has been granted permission to access by mart admins.
Unless your client changes, you should not have to run this setup ever again and
tokens will be managed in the background for you by the `xmart4` package.

## Underlying functionality

So how does this work in practice? The first time you call the `xmart4_api()` in
a session (either directly or by using any function to access marts or tables),
if a token is not manually provided, a token will be automatically generated. `get_xmart_token()`
will be run to get an access token for either the xMart4 UAT or PROD server, depending
on the API call. This will then be stored in the package environment, `xmart4:::.xmart_env`.

Every subsequent time an API call is made, that environment is searched for the
correct token (UAT or PROD), and if the token doesn't exist or has expired, a new
token will be generated. All of this should never require you to directly
request a token or manage token access. Separate tokens are managed for both
UAT and PROD servers simultaneously.

Once setup, in every session, you can just directly start requesting access to marts and
tables with `xmart4` functions, without having to specify the token

```{r eval=FALSE}
xmart4_mart(..., token = NULL) # don't actually need to specify token = NULL, it's the default
xmart4_table(..., token = NULL)
```

## Directly managing token access

The only instance where you might want to personally manage token access would be
if you're attempting to access the xMart4 API through multiple clients. You could
still let your primary client defined in your `.Renviron` run automatically, by
calling the xMart4 API without specifying the token.

For additional clients not setup this way, you can just directly request your tokens.
For instance, to set up and use a new access token for the UAT server:
```{r eval=FALSE}
token_uat_2 <- xmart4_token(client_id = "#######",
                            client_secret = "#######",
                            xmart_server = "UAT")

xmart4_mart(..., token = token_uat_2)
xmart4_table(..., token = token_uat_2)
```
You can check the time left on your token using `xmart_token_time(token_uat_2)`
(they come with 60 minutes of validity once generated).
Hopefully you don't need to manually manage your tokens, but these wrappers
should still make the process as painless as possible as xmart4 streamlines the
POST requests and expiry checks.
